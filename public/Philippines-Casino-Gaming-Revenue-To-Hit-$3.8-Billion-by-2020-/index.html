The country’s current market value is estimated at $2.5 billion, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5% through 2020.</p>
<p>Much of this growth can be attributed to the opening of new casinos in the country. In 2015, for instance, Manila saw the opening of Resorts World Manila – the country’s largest casino resort. As more casinos open their doors, the industry is expected to continue its rapid growth.</p>
<p>“The Philippines gaming market is one of the most promising in Asia with significant potential for gaming development over the next five years,” said Research and Markets senior analyst Chen Zhao. “The increasing number of foreign tourists, growing economy, and rising disposable incomes are key drivers for the market growth.”</p>
<p>In addition to new casino openings, another factor driving growth is the increasing popularity of Philippine gambling among Asian players. Companies are increasingly targeting this market by expanding their operations in the Philippines. In fact, Singapore-based gaming company Genting Group recently announced that it will be investing $1 billion in a new integrated casino resort in Boracay.</p>
<p>The Philippines has long been seen as a gambling hotspot in Asia, and it looks like this trend is only going to continue in the years ahead. With rising incomes and an ever-growing tourism industry, the Philippines is poised for continued success in the casino gaming market.</p>

Despite this, there are countless opportunities for western and Asian casino operators who are looking to establish a foothold in the country.</p>
<p>So what does it take to build a successful casino gaming industry in the Philippines?</p>
<p>There are a few key things that need to be taken into account:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Regulatory Landscape</li>
</ol>
<p>Casino gaming is strictly regulated in the Philippines, so it’s important to understand the applicable laws and regulations before setting up shop. There are a number of government bodies that are involved in casino regulation, including the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Make sure you have a clear understanding of which agency regulates casino gaming in the Philippines and what their specific requirements are.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Market Potential</li>
</ol>
<p>The Philippines is a huge market with a population of over 100 million people. And while casino gambling is currently only available to high-rollers, there is potential for growth as the industry matures. In fact, PAGCOR has recently announced plans to expand casino operations to include more mass-market players. So there is certainly room for growth in the Philippines gaming market.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>The Competition<br> exerted by Other Casino Operators<br>Asian operators have been aggressively expanding into Southeast Asia in recent years, and competition for market share will be fierce in the Philippines. So it’s important to understand who your competitors are and what they’re offering. It’s also important to have a well-defined marketing strategy to differentiate your casino from the competition.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Infrastructure Requirements<br>Setting up a casino requires extensive infrastructure, including hotel rooms, convention space, restaurants, retail outlets, and more. So it’s important to make sure that you have the necessary resources in place before starting operations. Additionally, you’ll need to ensure that your casino meets all of the relevant safety and security standards.</p>
