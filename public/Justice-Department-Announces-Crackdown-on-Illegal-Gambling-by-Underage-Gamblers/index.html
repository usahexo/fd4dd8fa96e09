The crackdown will focus on online gambling and the use of offshore websites to place bets.</p>
<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions made the announcement at a press conference in Washington, DC. He was joined by representatives from the FBI, the IRS, and other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“Online gambling is illegal for minors in every state in the country,” Sessions said. “We are going to crack down on these rogue websites that exploit children and steal money from their parents.”</p>
<p>According to the Department of Justice, underage gambling is a multibillion-dollar industry. In 2017, the FBI conducted more than 4,000 investigations into illegal gambling, resulting in nearly 1,000 arrests.</p>
<p>“We are committed to protecting our children from the dangers of online gambling,” Sessions said. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to shut down these illegal operations and protect our kids.”</p>
<h1 id="SAGaming-Sites-Banned-in-United-States-After-Investigation-Finds-Children-gambled-on-site"><a href="#SAGaming-Sites-Banned-in-United-States-After-Investigation-Finds-Children-gambled-on-site" class="headerlink" title="SAGaming Sites Banned in United States After Investigation Finds Children gambled on site"></a>SAGaming Sites Banned in United States After Investigation Finds Children gambled on site</h1><p>After a two-year investigation, the United States has banned six gaming websites that allow children to gamble. The websites—SAGaming, CandaLottery, LottoLogix, UKNationalLotto, SwissLotto, and SpanishLotto—allow users to bet on simulated casino games using real-world currencies.</p>
<p>Investigators say they found evidence that children as young as eight had gambled on the sites. In some cases, these children lost hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>“These websites are nothing more than online casinos aimed at children,” said Marlyn Payne, a spokesperson for the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). “They lure kids in with the promise of easy money and then bombard them with pop-ups and ads for other gambling sites. It’s despicable.”</p>
<p>The FTC has filed a lawsuit against the operators of SAGaming, CanadaLottery, LottoLogix, UKNationalLotto, SwissLotto, and SpanishLotto. They are seeking to have the websites shut down and to refund all lost money to affected users.</p>
<h1 id="Canada-Moves-to-Ban-SAGaming-After-Investigation-Finds-Children-gambled-on-site"><a href="#Canada-Moves-to-Ban-SAGaming-After-Investigation-Finds-Children-gambled-on-site" class="headerlink" title="Canada Moves to Ban SAGaming After Investigation Finds Children gambled on site"></a>Canada Moves to Ban SAGaming After Investigation Finds Children gambled on site</h1><p>The Canadian government has announced that it is moving to ban SAGaming, after an investigation found that the site was allowing children to gamble.</p>
<p>SAGaming is a website where users can bet on simulated sporting matches. The site has come under fire in recent months for its lax age verification procedures, which have allowed children as young as 13 to gamble on the site.</p>
<p>“We cannot allow SAGaming to operate in Canada,” said Canadian Minister of Justice Jody Wilson-Raybould. “Not only are they putting our children at risk, but they are also profiting from their gambling addiction.”</p>
<p>The move to ban SAGaming comes after the Canadian government conducted a six-month investigation into the site. The investigation found that SAGaming had failed to properly verify the ages of its users, and that many children were using the site to gamble.</p>
<p>In addition to banning SAGaming, the Canadian government is also calling for stronger age verification procedures for all online gambling websites.</p>
<h1 id="Australia-Launches-Criminal-Investigation-Into-SAGaming"><a href="#Australia-Launches-Criminal-Investigation-Into-SAGaming" class="headerlink" title="Australia Launches Criminal Investigation Into SAGaming"></a>Australia Launches Criminal Investigation Into SAGaming</h1><p>The Australian Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry has announced a criminal investigation into SAGaming, one of the world’s largest online gambling operators.</p>
<p>The news comes as a major shock to the online gambling industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. SAGaming is one of the world’s largest online gambling companies, with over $4 billion in revenue last year.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission alleges that SAGaming engaged in “unfair and unconscionable conduct” by targeting vulnerable customers and deliberately deceiving them about the risks of gambling. The company is also accused of withholding winnings from players and refusing to pay out legitimate bets.</p>
<p>Officials from SAGaming have denied all allegations of wrongdoing, saying that they operate within the bounds of Australian law. They insist that their games are fair and that they do not target vulnerable customers.</p>
<p>However, the Royal Commission says that it has evidence of widespread misconduct at SAGaming and is now investigating the company for criminal offences.</p>
<h1 id="Wonga-Shut-Down-After-being-Linked-to-Illegal-Gambling-by-Underage-Gamblers"><a href="#Wonga-Shut-Down-After-being-Linked-to-Illegal-Gambling-by-Underage-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Wonga Shut Down After being Linked to Illegal Gambling by Underage Gamblers"></a>Wonga Shut Down After being Linked to Illegal Gambling by Underage Gamblers</h1><p>Wonga, a payday loan company in the United Kingdom, has been shut down by the Financial Conduct Authority after being linked to illegal gambling by underage gamblers.</p>
<p>The company allowed children as young as 16 years old to borrow money that they then used to gamble on casino-style games, according to the Financial Conduct Authority. Wonga also did not properly vet its customers or carry out adequate checks into their ability to repay the loans.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Wonga has been in trouble with the authorities. In 2014, the company was fined £2.6 million for sending fake legal letters to customers in order to pressure them into paying debts.</p>
<p>The closure of Wonga will come as a relief to many of its customers, who have been struggling with high interest rates and unaffordable payments. The company charged an average annual interest rate of 5,853%, and some customers were being charged as much as 4,500%.</p>
<p>People who are struggling with debt should seek help from organisations such as Citizens Advice or Debt Advice Foundation. These organisations can provide free advice on how to manage your debt and may be able to help you negotiate repayment plans with your creditors.</p>
