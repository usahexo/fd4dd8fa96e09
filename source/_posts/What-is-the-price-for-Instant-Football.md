#  What is the price for Instant Football?

Instant Football is a great game to play with friends and family. The price for Instant Football varies depending on the retailer. Some retailers may offer the game at a lower price, while others may sell the game at a higher price. It is important to compare prices before purchasing the game to ensure you are getting the best deal.

#  How many teams can play in a game of Instant Football?

Instant Football is a fast paced, low commitment game that can be played by any number of people. The basic premise is to score goals by throwing the ball at a goalpost and then defending your own goal.

The game can be played with any number of teams, but the ideal number is six players per team. With more players, the game becomes too chaotic and it is difficult to keep track of who is scoring goals and who is defending.

With fewer players, the game becomes one-sided and can quickly become boring for the losing team.

Instant Football offers a range of game modes to keep players entertained for hours on end. Whether you’re a fan of competitive play or want to take things at a more leisurely pace, there’s something for everyone in Instant Football.

The main game mode is the standard match. Two teams of eleven players go head-to-head in 45 minutes of intense football action. Whoever scores the most goals, wins!

For those who want a more casual experience, there’s the option to play against the AI instead of another player. Take on the computer in a one-on-one match and see if you can outscore them.

If you’d prefer a bigger challenge, then why not try out the tournament mode? Play in a series of matches against other teams, each with their own unique difficulty level. The victor is the team that can stay alive longest and comes out on top!
