#  How to Get Your Taxes Back from a Gambling Establishment Win

You’ve struck it fortunate at the casino and currently you’re thinking of how to declare your taxes back. Here is a guide on how to do just that.

1. Check the Gaming Revenue Tax Act

The first step is to check whether your casino winnings are taxable or not. This is governed by the Gaming Revenue Tax Act, which classifies gambling income and losses as non-taxable revenue. So if you’re a Canadian resident, your casino profits are not taxable. However, there are specific conditions which must be met:

The winnings must be from bona fide gambling activities; and The winnings must not be from unlawful activities such as betting or wagering.

2. Validate Your Winnings With Casino Records

Assuming that you meet the criteria above, you will need to validate your winnings with casino records. This can be done by providing copies of your gaming tickets or receipts to Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). If you happen to lose money while gambling, these losses can also be claimed as tax deductions. Again, documentary evidence will be required for verification purposes.

3. Report Your Winnings in Your Income Tax Return

Once you have successfully validated your casino wins with IRAS, the next step is to report these wins in your income tax return. This can be done through Form IR8A, which is available on the IRAS website. The form will require details such as your name, NRIC number and total amount of casino profits declared. It’s important to note that only profits above S$10,000 are taxable; any amount lower than that is exempt from taxation.

 So there you have it – a simple guide on how to get your taxes back from a gambling establishment win! Just remember to follow the steps laid out above and keep all relevant documentation in case of an audit by IRAS.

#  How to File Taxes for Gambling Winnings
