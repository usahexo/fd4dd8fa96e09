Philippines casino gaming revenue is expected to hit $3.8 billion by 2020, according to a new report by Research and Markets. The country’s current market value is estimated at $2.5 billion, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5% through 2020.

Much of this growth can be attributed to the opening of new casinos in the country. In 2015, for instance, Manila saw the opening of Resorts World Manila – the country’s largest casino resort. As more casinos open their doors, the industry is expected to continue its rapid growth.

“The Philippines gaming market is one of the most promising in Asia with significant potential for gaming development over the next five years,” said Research and Markets senior analyst Chen Zhao. “The increasing number of foreign tourists, growing economy, and rising disposable incomes are key drivers for the market growth.”

In addition to new casino openings, another factor driving growth is the increasing popularity of Philippine gambling among Asian players. Companies are increasingly targeting this market by expanding their operations in the Philippines. In fact, Singapore-based gaming company Genting Group recently announced that it will be investing $1 billion in a new integrated casino resort in Boracay.

The Philippines has long been seen as a gambling hotspot in Asia, and it looks like this trend is only going to continue in the years ahead. With rising incomes and an ever-growing tourism industry, the Philippines is poised for continued success in the casino gaming market.
