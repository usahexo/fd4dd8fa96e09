#  Foxborough, MA – No Sports Betting for Chelsea FC

In a surprising turn of events, the town of Foxborough, MA denied Chelsea Football Club’s request to start a sports betting operation. This is a big blow to the London-based team, as they were hoping to gain an edge on their competition by allowing fans to place bets on their games.

Interestingly, this decision comes at a time when other teams in the area are being allowed to open up sports betting operations. The Boston Red Sox, New England Patriots, and Boston Bruins all have sports betting facilities within walking distance of the Chelsea FC’s new stadium.

Despite being located in close proximity to these teams, Chelsea FC was not given the same opportunity. When asked about the decision, Town Manager William Keegan had this to say:

"The reason we denied Chelsea's request is because they wanted to operate outside of our zoning bylaws. They wanted to place their facility in an area that is designated for commercial use, which is not allowed."

Chelsea FC representatives responded by saying that they will explore their legal options and hope to overturn the decision.
