# Borderlands 2: How to Get 3 Vault Symbols on Slot Machine Game Machine at Toto Casino

Borderlands 2 is a popular video game that features a slot machine mini-game. Players can gamble on the slot machines in hopes of winning big payouts, including the elusive 3 Vault Symbols. In this article, we will provide some tips on how to get 3 Vault Symbols on the slot machine game machine at Toto Casino.

## Tip 1: Choose the Right Machine

Not all slot machines are created equal. Some machines have a higher chance of paying out big wins, including the 3 Vault Symbols. Look for machines that have a high payout rate and a higher chance of triggering bonus rounds.

## Tip 2: Bet Max

To increase your chances of hitting the 3 Vault Symbols, bet the maximum amount on each spin. This will increase the potential payout if you do hit the symbols.

## Tip 3: Use the Torgue Slot Machines

The Torgue Slot Machines in the Torgue DLC have a higher chance of hitting the 3 Vault Symbols. These machines require Torgue Tokens to play, which can be obtained by completing certain missions in the DLC.

## Tip 4: Play with Friends

Playing with friends can increase your chances of hitting the 3 Vault Symbols. The more machines you play, the higher the chance of hitting the symbols on one of them.

## Tip 5: Practice Patience

Finally, it is important to practice patience when playing the slot machines. The 3 Vault Symbols are rare, and it may take many spins before you hit them. Don't get discouraged and keep playing.

## Conclusion
