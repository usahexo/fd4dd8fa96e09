#  Musical Bingo Comes to Belarus!

You may be wondering what musical bingo is. Musical bingo is a game that combines the excitement of bingo with the fun of listening to music. Players listen to a piece of music and then mark off numbers on their cards as they are called. The first player to mark off all of the numbers on their card wins the game.

Belarus is the latest country to introduce musical bingo. The game was introduced in December of 2017 and has been gaining in popularity ever since. There are now several clubs throughout the country that offer musical bingo nights.

So how does it work? Players purchase a card with a list of numbers ranging from 1 to 75. Five numbers are then drawn at random and played aloud. As each number is called, players mark it off on their cards. The first player to mark off all of the numbers on their card wins the game.

There are several variations of musical bingo available, including progressive jackpot games and “coverall” games in which players must cover all of the numbers on their card in order to win. Some clubs also offer themed nights, such as “Top 40 Hits” or “80s Classics” nights.

One club in Minsk even offers a special VIP room for players who want an extra-special experience. This room comes with its own private host, who can help players choose songs and explain the rules of the game.

So why is musical bingo so popular? For starters, it’s a fun and easy way to learn about new music. It’s also perfect for groups or parties, as it encourages conversation and interaction among players. And finally, it’s a great way to get some exercise – after all, walking around to mark off numbers can add up!
