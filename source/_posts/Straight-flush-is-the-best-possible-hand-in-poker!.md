#  Straight flush is the best possible hand in poker!

A straight flush is a poker hand containing five cards of consecutive rank, all of the same suit. It ranks above a full house and below a four of a kind.

Straight flushes occur about once in every 650,000 hands, so they are quite rare. When two players have straight flushes, the one with the highest-ranking card wins.

Some people like to bet on straight flushes because the odds of winning are pretty good. In fact, the odds of getting a straight flush are about 1 in 72,192. So if you bet $1 on a straight flush and it wins, you'll get back $72.19 in return!

If you're looking for a high-paying poker hand, then you should definitely aim for a straight flush.
