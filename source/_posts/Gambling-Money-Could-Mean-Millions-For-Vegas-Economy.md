#  Gambling Money Could Mean Millions For Vegas Economy

Gambling is big business in Las Vegas and it has been for a long time. In 2015, gambling revenue in the city was more than $6.5 billion, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board. That accounted for more than two-thirds of all gaming revenue in the state.

While casino gambling is still king in Sin City, there's been a shift in recent years towards other forms of gambling, such as sports betting and daily fantasy sports (DFS). In fact, the Nevada Gaming Commission issued its first ever license for a DFS company last year.

It's not just casinos that are benefiting from gambling money. The economy of Las Vegas as a whole is thriving thanks to all the spending by tourists who come to gamble.

There are now more than 150,000 people employed in Las Vegas because of the casino and hospitality industry, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. That's up from just over 100,000 workers less than 10 years ago.

And with legalized gambling spreading to other states, the growth prospects for Las Vegas appear bright. Just this week, Mississippi became the latest state to legalize sports betting. More states are likely to follow suit, given that black market spending on sports betting is estimated at around $150 billion annually.

All told, gambling revenue in Las Vegas could easily reach $10 billion or more in the next few years, resulting in even more jobs and economic growth for the city.

#  Las Vegas Hopes Gambling Money Arrives In Time For The Holidays

The city of Las Vegas is in a race against the clock to bring in enough gambling money to pay its bills before the end of the year.

According to recent reports, Las Vegas is on track to run out of money by the end of December if things don't change. The main issue is a decline in tourism, as well as a decrease in gambling revenue.

To make up for the shortfall, the city is hoping that some last-minute gambling money will arrive in time for the holidays. Officials are asking residents and visitors to gamble more at the city's casinos and hotels.

Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman is hopeful that the extra effort will be enough to avoid any financial problems. "We're cautiously optimistic that we can make up that shortfall," she said in a recent interview.

In addition to increased gambling, Goodman is also calling for a renewal of tourism taxes that would help fund city projects. The proposed taxes include an increase in the hotel room tax and a new levy on car rentals.

Goodman says that the additional money is needed to support projects such as improvements at the city's convention center and new schools. "We need those resources for our future, and we'll do everything we can to get them," she said.

Despite the efforts of Mayor Goodman and others, there is no guarantee that enough gambling money will arrive in time to save Las Vegas from financial trouble. With just a few weeks left until the end of the year, it remains to be seen whether or not this southern Nevada city will be able to avert disaster.

#  Increased Tourism Means More Opportunity For Gambling Money

Casinos have been known to be one of the prime beneficiaries of an increase in tourism. When more people come into town, there is more opportunity for gambling money. And with many casinos located near popular tourist destinations, it’s a win-win for both the casino and the town.

One recent example is Atlantic City. The city has been struggling in recent years, but a surge in tourism has helped to turn things around for the casinos there. In March of this year, total gambling revenues were up 13 percent from the same month last year. This was largely due to an increase in visitation numbers; in fact, Atlantic City saw its first weekly increase in hotel occupancy rates in six years.

This is good news for the city and its residents, as well as for the casino industry as a whole. It’s also important to note that not all casinos are created equal; some are faring better than others in this current climate. MGM Resorts International, for example, saw a 7 percent increase in revenue from its Las Vegas casinos during the first quarter of 2017. Caesars Entertainment Corporation, on the other hand, reported a 3 percent decrease during that same time period.

The bottom line is that when tourism increases, so does gambling revenue – and that’s good news for casino operators everywhere.

#  Bringing In Gambling Money Could Save Las Vegas' Struggling Economy

It has been no secret that Las Vegas' economy has been struggling as of late. However, a recent study suggests that legalizing and regulating gambling could be the solution to saving Sin City's economy.

The research, conducted by Dr. William R. Eadington of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada, Reno, found that regulated gambling could produce enough revenue to fill a $1.5 billion budget hole. In fact, in a best-case scenario where gambling is legalized and taxed at 30 percent, the industry would bring in an annual haul of $3.8 billion.

"Legalized gambling is not a panacea for all of Nevada's budgetary ills, but it can make an important contribution," said Eadington in a statement about the report. "Given these results, it would be penny-wise and pound-foolish not to consider this source of revenue as part of any effort to address our current fiscal crisis."

The study also found that the legalization and regulation of gambling could create nearly 24,000 jobs in the state. These new jobs would include people working in casinos and related industries, as well as those who provide support services like food and lodging.

While some may argue that legalizing gambling would have negative consequences for society as a whole, Dr. Eadington's report suggests that such concerns are overblown. "Concerns about crime and social ills are often raised in connection with proposals to legalize gambling," continued Eadington in his statement. "However, there is no evidence that legalized gambling leads to increased crime or social problems."

With Las Vegas' economy on the decline, it may be time for lawmakers to consider legalizing and regulating gambling as a way to bring much-needed revenue into the state. Thanks to Dr. Eadington's report, it is now clear that such a move could benefit not just the city's coffers but also its workforce.

#  Dependence On Gambling Money Could Spell Trouble For Las Vegas

As casino operators in Las Vegas brace for the possibility of legalized sports gambling, some are voicing concerns that too much of the gambling money flow is derived from a single source.

According to data from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, casinos in Clark County won $11.2 billion from gamblers in 2017. The lion's share of that came from slot machines, which accounted for more than $8.5 billion in revenue. This suggests that casinos are largely dependent on money from problem gamblers, who tend to lose more money than people who gamble responsibly.

If sports gambling is legalized and becomes popular, it could eat into this revenue stream. This could have a negative impact on casino operators' bottom lines and could lead to job losses in the industry.

There is also a risk that legalized sports gambling could spawn an increase in crime and other social ills. This is already a problem in states where sports gambling is legal, such as New Jersey. In that state, arrests for illegal betting have increased since sports gambling was legalized there in 2013.

All of these concerns underscore why it is important for casino operators to get a piece of the sports gambling pie if it is legalized in Nevada. If they don't, they could be left behind as competitors take market share away from them.
