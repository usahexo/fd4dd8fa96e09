#  What is the paddypower black jack table?

The paddypower black jack table is a unique table game that offers players the chance to win big payouts. The game is played using a standard deck of 52 cards, and the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. In addition to normal payouts, there are also bonus payouts available for specific hands.

# How to play

To begin, all players must place their bets. The dealer will then deal two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to the dealer. The player's goal is to beat the dealer's hand by getting closer to 21 than the dealer. If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose their bet. If the dealer goes over 21, they bust and all players who haven't busted win even money on their bets.

If both the player and dealer have the same point total (e.g., 17), it is called a "push" and no one wins or loses money. After each player has had their turn, the dealer will deal another card face up - this is called the "up card". Based on this card, players will now have a better idea of what they need to do in order to beat the dealer.

For example, if the dealer has an Ace showing as their up card, then they likely have a high hand and the player should not take any more cards (since they could go over 21). Or if the player has two Kings showing, then they should hit since they have a good chance of getting close to 21 without busting.

# Payouts

The standard payouts for black jack are as follows:

- 3:2 for winning black jack hand (e.g., 2Kings vs Ace)
- 1:1 for any other winning hand
- Insurance pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack

In addition to these payouts, there are also bonus payouts available for specific hands:
- Natural Blackjack (two cards totaling 21) pays out 3:2 
- Five Card Trick (five consecutive cards, all different suits) pays out 25:1

#  What is the High 5 Games black jack table?

The High 5 Games black jack table is a casino game that allows players to bet on the outcome of a hand of blackjack. The game is played using a standard deck of 52 cards, and the goal is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting 21 points, or by having a higher score than the dealer without going over 21.

Players can bet on their own hand, or they can bet on the dealer's hand. If the player bets on their own hand and wins, they will receive a payout based on the size of their bet. If the player bets on the dealer's hand and wins, they will not receive any payout, but they will receive a bonus depending on the rules of the particular casino game.

If the player loses either type of bet, they will lose their entire bet amount.
